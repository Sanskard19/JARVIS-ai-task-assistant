# JARVIS-ai-task-assistant
In Semester 2, we conceptualized and developed JARVIS (Just A Really Versatile Intelligent System) — an autonomous AI-powered personal assistant built to manage digital workflows, reduce manual effort, and integrate seamlessly across platforms. JARVIS addresses a common problem faced by students and professionals alike: juggling tasks, deadlines, and communications across multiple disconnected platforms like Google Classroom, WhatsApp, Instagram, and more. Our solution was to create a centralized system that could not only store and retrieve information but also act on it autonomously — uploading assignments, scheduling tasks, and sending reminders without constant user input.

JARVIS is powered by a multi-agent architecture, combining modules for natural language understanding, task planning, execution, and privacy enforcement. We used React.js for the frontend, and Django + PostgreSQL for the backend, along with NLP pipelines built using transformer-based models like BERT. The assistant uses RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) techniques to understand user intent and generate context-aware responses, and integrates with APIs from platforms like Google Classroom and WhatsApp Business. With over 92% task success rate and high user satisfaction in testing, JARVIS demonstrates how AI can move beyond chatbots to become proactive digital collaborators. Future plans include incorporating reinforcement learning, multi-modal inputs (like image/audio), and collaborative workspace features for teams.
